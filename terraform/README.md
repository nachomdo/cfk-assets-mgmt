# Confluent For Kubernetes for assets management

### Why move away from JulieOps? 

JulieOps development was officially abandoned Nov 25, 2022. No new features or bugfixes are expected, therefore we need to look for officially supported tools to manage Kafka assets. Aside from the lack of official or community support, there is also some missing functionality as can be seen in the table below.
